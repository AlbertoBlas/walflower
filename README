Walflower is a set of ActionScript libraries to facilitate working with ePub files 
in Flash's Text Layout Framework. Pieces of it are being migrated up to this repository
as I can modularize and organize them out of an existing eBook reader project.

The library integrates the nochump zip library, which it uses to unzip ePub files.

Everything is MIT License.
